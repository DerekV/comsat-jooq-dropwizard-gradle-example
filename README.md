# Comsat Dropwizard+jOOQ Example

A single-file Dropwizard embedded Java 1.7+ featuring fiber-blocking JAX-RS web services backed by fiber-blocking jOOQ DB access.

## Getting started

Just edit `build.gradle`for JVM arguments and system properties, then feel free to play with the code or just give it a try as it stands.

To run it:

```
./gradlew # CTRL+C to stop
```

The available services are printed by Dropwizard on stdout during bootstrap.
